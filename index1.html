				<h1> About Us </h1>
			</div>
			<div class="container1">
				<p> Neville Longbottom Liberty Law Firm is a Trinidad based multi-faceted law firm 
					that focuses mainly on Family law and Personal injury law but is also equipped to
					handle a variety of cases. <br> Liberty law was established in August 2008 after Neville
					resigned from Oxfords and Son law firm in London. He was employed there for three years before 
					he made a name for himself and decided to branch off on his own. Neville, who has roots in Trinidad
					because of his mother, decided to open his practice here. However, he still gets clients from around 
					the world. Neville attribute this to his attention to detail, approachable demeanour and passion for
					his work and wanting to help others. <br> Neville brought in Ronald Weasley just under two years of the
					firm being established, as his clientele was growing. They introduced child counselling and support soon 
					after for the children in surrounding communities. They changed the minds of the people in the community 
					and made counselling sessions less of a taboo. Hermoine Granger was brought in on cases when a psychologist
					was required and her love for the people and the island made her stay. And four years later, Communication major,
					Ginny Weasley, was brought in, thus completing the team that you see before you. <br> The team has worked on numerous
					cases, some being purely pro bono as the law firm has a love for helping their clients more than getting a paycheck. The 
					law firm has never lost a case, whether nationally or internationally. They have gotten cases where agreements were 
					settled outside of the court and no client has ever walked away unsatisfied. This makes Liberty Law firm a top ranking 
					law firm, right up there with internal firms.
